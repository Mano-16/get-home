# GetRentalHome
  I have recreated the rental home/place website based on the user experience.

  ## Filters
  Users have option to filter what type of home user searching. In addtion to that, based on the rating, rent, place users can do the filter and they can able to reset the filter as well.
  ## Authentication
  Users should have account to get the owner full details or upload their home.
  Here I used firebase for authentication and formik for authentication for validation.
  ## User Permission

  ### Favourites
  Users can add the home to its favourite list for future reference.
  
  ### Adding Home
  Users those are havinng account can able to upload their home to avail for other users. Users(Owners) should give home details (including images of home) and contact numbers to upload their home.
 ## Admin Permission
 once the user uploaded their home, the approval will go to admin(admin credentials). Admin can validate the home details and contact numbers. based on that admin can approve or reject it.
 If admin approves, the home details moved to main dashboard and it will be avail for other users.
 Admin has the option to delete the home from main dashboard.
